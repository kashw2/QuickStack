# Terraform

This directory holds all Terraform IaC.

QuickStack provides Terraform configuration that facilitates the stand up of infrastructure that is both scalable and on
budget. Considerations have been made to allow easy upscaling of resources provided in Azure while also providing a
solid foundation for most early business use cases.
